Based on the data summary, I will create a visualization that reveals meaningful insights.

**Plot Selection:**
Given the large number of unique cities (43009) and the fact that we want to understand the distribution of population across different cities, I will choose a **HISTOGRAM** plot type.

**Pseudo-Code:**
```markdown
TYPE: HISTOGRAM
TITLE: "Population Distribution Across Cities"
X: population
X_name: "Population"
Y: COUNT()
Y_name: "Frequency"
NBINS: 50
NORMALIZE: true
```
**Explanation:**

* We use a histogram to visualize the distribution of population across different cities.
* The x-axis represents the population, and the y-axis represents the frequency of each population value.
* We use 50 bins to ensure a good balance between detail and simplicity.
* We normalize the histogram to show the proportion of each population value.

This visualization will provide insight into the distribution of population across different cities, allowing us to understand which population ranges are most common and how they are distributed.
